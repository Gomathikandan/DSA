Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles.
If sum of angles is equal to 180, then triangle can be formed, else it can't be formed.
Input: 45 45 45
Expected Output: 
Triangle cannot be formed
Explanation -> We are getting 3 inputs, that is three angles of triangle, but here the sum of three angles that is 45+45+45 is not equal to 180 so Triangle cannot be formed is the output.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //TIP Press <shortcut actionId="ShowIntentionActions"/> with your caret at the highlighted text

        System.out.printf("Hello and welcome!");
        System.out.println("Learning DSA");
        prob2();

    }

    public static  void prob2() {
        System.out.println("Enter 3 values to form triangle ");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int[] numbers = new int[3];
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter number " + (i + 1));
            numbers[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        for (int j = 0; j< numbers.length; j++) {
            sum = sum + numbers[j];

        }
        if (sum == 180){
            System.out.println("The triangle is solved ");
        }else{
            System.out.println("The triangle is unsolved ");
        }



    }
}
